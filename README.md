### ADT-Project-Group-31
IndiaVoyage is a web-based platform designed to help travelers explore and plan their journeys across India's vibrant and diverse landscape. With a rich database of must-visit destinations, we will recommend places to visit based on the user's preferences about where they want to visit, the type of the place, google rating, the significance of the place, etc. From the recommendations, users can make a travel itinerary for their next trip to India. This will be a one-stop destination for users to find out about various must-see places in India and, at the same time, add it to their itinerary with one click. IndiaVoyage aims to simplify travel planning and enhance the overall travel experiences for users who want to customize their itinerary on their own.


Project Description

Objective:
IndiaVoyage aims to assist travelers in discovering and planning their journeys across India by providing a list of recommended locations per their preference of place of visit, city, state, religious or historical, google rating preference, type of beach, mountains, etc. With the list of locations, we will be providing information  such as what time is best to visit, if DSLR is allowed, how much time you should ideally spend, etc, along with a few pictures and a description of the project. This project aims to solve the problem of people who like to plan their trip to India on their own and don’t want to follow standard itineraries made by travel planners or travel influencers. This application will also be useful for people who want to become travel influencers for Indian Tourism. For this project, we are scoping it down to India, however as per the availability of data, the project can be scale!

Usefulness:
          
Whenever we search for an app or website to recommend a travel destination while planning trips we either find blogs or websites which tells us about a static list of locations which are based on someone else's preferences. It may or may not include the place of your interest. There is a very useful application named ‘Incredible India’; the app has a comprehensive list of locations in India and information about the locations, their maps, visa requirements, etc. However, the application doesn’t allow travelers’ to make their own travel bucket list. Our application has an edge here, we will filter according to the travelers’ preferences then suggest locations as per that and allow them to add the location to their respective bucket. Once they add the location, it will be saved and the traveler can update their bucket list at his/her convenience. Once they are done with visiting the places or they no longer like the curated list they can delete it. Following is the flow diagram of the application:'

Our dataset is a collection of must-visit places in India giving us detailed insights into the country's diverse heritage and geographical diversity as the dataset consists of historical, religious, natural wonders, and various hidden gems. Apart from the diversity in locations in the dataset, it has vital information about the place, like what time we should visit the place, how much average time people spend there, or even camera rules, entrance fees, etc. This detailed information profile allows us to make informed decisions and plan trips effectively. Generally, most other datasets available have the place's name, google rating, and generic information about the place. Our dataset allows us to put multiple filters on eliminating the places and gives a curated list of places users may want to visit.



Dataset
For the project, we will be working on the Kaggle dataset ‘Travel Dataset: Guide to India’s Must See Places.’ Our dataset consists of 16 columns and 324 rows. The columns include zone, state, city, name, type, establishment year, the time needed to visit, google rating, entrance fee, the airport in a 50km radius, weekly off, significance, and best time to visit. The dataset was curated by author Saket Kumar on kaggle covering places across India on 01/30/2024. This dataset was created for kagglers to explore and develop insightful applications to uncover captivating insights into India’s top destinations. This dataset also provides us with an opportunity to split the dataset into more detailed schemas using normalization.
