### ADT-Project-Group-31
IndiaVoyage aims to assist travelers in discovering and planning their journeys across India by providing a list of recommended locations per their preference of place of visit, city, state, religious or historical, google rating preference, type of beach, mountains, etc. With the list of locations, we will be providing information  such as what time is best to visit, if DSLR is allowed, how much time you should ideally spend, etc, along with a few pictures and a description of the project. This project aims to solve the problem of people who like to plan their trip to India on their own and don’t want to follow standard itineraries made by travel planners or travel influencers. This application will also be useful for people who want to become travel influencers for Indian Tourism. For this project, we are scoping it down to India, however as per the availability of data, the project can be scaled up.
